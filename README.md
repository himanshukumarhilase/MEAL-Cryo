# MEAL-Cryo : Developement of medium entropy alloy using lasers for cryogenic applications

**MEAL-Cryo** is a research project focused on developement of Fe-based medium entropy alloy using **laser powder bed fusion** and improving it's mechanical and fatigue properties using the **Laser Shock Peening (LSP)** and **Laser annealing/Laser hardening**. The laser shock peening parameters will be optimized to acheive the maximum pinning with black tape and paint as secrificial layer. The laser annealing/Laser hardening effect on the microstructure, mechanical and fatigue properties will be investigated.

## 🎯 Project Goals
 
 - Investigate the effect of microstructural, mechanical and fatigue properties of the alloy in the as deposited state.
 - Investigate the infulence of the laser shock peening (LSP) with tape and with paint on the microstructure, mechanical and fatigue properties of the developed Fe-based 
   medium entropy alloy.
 - Compare the improvements in the mechanical properties and fatigue behaviour of the alloy pre and post LSP treatement.
 - Evaluate the effect of laser annealing/Laser hardening on the microstructure, mechanical and fatigue behaviour of the developed Fe-based medium entropy alloy.
 - Compare the improvements in the mechanical and fatigue properties with as deposited and treated samples.
 - Disseminate reproducible data and analysis in open-access form
 - Share early results through preprints and open science platforms
